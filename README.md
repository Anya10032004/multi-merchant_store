# REST API mini project: Multi-merchant store 🏬

Flask project that builds a multi-merchant store REST API. It demonstrates user authentication with JWT, role-based access control, store and product management (CRUD), product claiming, database relationships using Flask-SQLAlchemy, and catalog features such as search, filtering, and pagination.
## 1. Project structure

```text
store_api_reference/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── errors.py
│   └── routes/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── helpers.py
│       ├── auth.py
│       ├── merchants.py
│       ├── products.py
│       ├── catalog.py
│       └── claims.py
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
└── run.py
```

The image you shared shows the important separation: application setup, configuration, models, errors, routes, and the entry point. This project keeps that same idea and splits routes by feature because this API has several resources.

## 2. Setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:

**Windows**
```bash
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set `DATABASE_URL`.

For MySQL, create the database first:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_store;
```

Example MySQL URL:

```text
mysql+pymysql://root:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:3306/db_store
```

For a quick local experiment without MySQL, use:

```text
sqlite:///store.db
```

`run.py` loads the `.env` file using `python-dotenv` before creating the app.

## 3. Run the API

```bash
python run.py
```

The development server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

The example calls `db.create_all()` when run directly so you can start learning without a migration setup. For a production project, use Flask-Migrate/Alembic instead of relying on `create_all()` to evolve your schema.

## 4. API endpoint overview

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api` | Public | Health check |
| POST | `/api/register` | Public | Register a user or merchant |
| POST | `/api/login` | Public | Login and receive a JWT |
| POST | `/api/merchants` | Merchant | Create merchant profile |
| GET | `/api/merchant/me` | Merchant | Get own merchant profile |
| PUT | `/api/merchant/me` | Merchant | Update own merchant profile |
| GET | `/api/merchants` | Merchant | List merchant profiles |
| GET | `/api/merchants/<id>` | Authenticated | Get merchant and its products |
| POST | `/api/products` | Merchant | Create a product |
| GET | `/api/products/mine` | Merchant | List own products |
| PUT | `/api/products/<id>` | Merchant | Update own product |
| DELETE | `/api/products/<id>` | Merchant | Delete own product |
| GET | `/api/catalog` | Public | Browse/search available products |
| GET | `/api/catalog/<id>` | Public | Get one catalog product |
| POST | `/api/claims` | User | Claim a product and reduce stock |
| GET | `/api/claims` | User | List own claims |

For protected endpoints, send the token in the request header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## 5. Example request bodies

Register:

```json
{
  "name": "Anya",
  "email": "anya@example.com",
  "password": "example-password",
  "role": "merchant"
}
```

Create merchant profile:

```json
{
  "store_name": "Anya Store",
  "description": "A small online store",
  "address": "South Tangerang",
  "phone": "08123456789"
}
```

Create product:

```json
{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "A sample laptop",
  "price": 12000000,
  "stock": 5
}
```

Claim a product as a user:

```json
{
  "product_id": 1,
  "quantity": 2
}
```

Catalog filters:

```text
GET /api/catalog?search=laptop&merchant_id=1&page=1&per_page=10
```

## 6. How the architecture works

- `run.py`: creates the app and starts the development server.
- `app/__init__.py`: contains `create_app()`, initializes extensions, and registers Blueprints.
- `config.py`: stores settings such as the database URL and JWT secret.
- `models.py`: defines database tables and serialization methods.
- `errors.py`: centralizes HTTP and unexpected error responses.
- `routes/`: contains endpoint functions grouped by feature.
- `routes/helpers.py`: contains shared route helpers, including role authorization.

### Request flow

```text
Client / Postman
      |
      v
Route Blueprint
      |
      v
JWT authentication (if protected)
      |
      v
Role authorization (if required)
      |
      v
SQLAlchemy model / database
      |
      v
JSON response
```

## 7. Important learning notes

1. A Blueprint groups related endpoints. It does not create a separate Flask application.
2. The application factory lets you configure and initialize the app in one place.
3. `db` is initialized once in `app/__init__.py`, then imported where database access is needed.
4. `@jwt_required()` verifies the access token. `@role_required("merchant")` checks the role claim after authentication.
5. `get_jwt_identity()` returns the identity stored in the token. This project stores the user ID as a string.
6. Passwords are hashed before storage. The password hash is never returned in API responses or included in JWT claims.
7. A merchant can only update or delete products belonging to that merchant.
8. A claim reduces stock and creates a claim record in the same database transaction.

This is a teaching reference, not a production-hardened service. Before production, add database migrations, stronger input validation, rate limiting, tests, HTTPS, secure secret management, and transaction/concurrency handling for stock updates.
